Hiperwalk

High Performance Quantum Walk Simulation

HiPerWalk is a freeware open-source program that allows 
the user to perform simulations of quantum walks on graphs 
using HPC. The user can use the parallel resources of the 
computer, such as accelerator cards, multicore CPU and 
GPGPU to speedup the overall process without knowing 
parallel programming. It is under development and 
employs Python, OpenCL, Neblina, and Gnuplot languages.
